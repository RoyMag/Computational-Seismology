# Computational-Seismology
Codes for a few of the things in seismology

Here I'll be adding some scripts for seismic tomography and in general computational seismology related topics.
Hope it might help you!

All programs are written using Shell-Scripting, AWK and Python. All graphs are plotted using GMT.
